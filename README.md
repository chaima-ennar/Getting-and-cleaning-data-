# Getting-and-cleaning-data-
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
To run the R script you should download the dataset.
The result  of the script is shown in text file `tidy.txt`.
The script does the following functions:

-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
